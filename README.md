#Time for a Drink 

The purpose of this web app is to help people with the process of preparing their own mixed cocktails.

There are four pages to help with this process.  The first page is the Home Page which includes a search function to look for drinks by various categories like name of cocktail or ingredients in the cocktail.  After searching, it will display a picture of the drink with its name.  Clicking on the picture will then take you to the ingredients page.  

The ingredients page will display the recipe and instructions for making the drink.  You will also be able to save the drink for later testing or save it to your favorites.

The shopping page is a soon to be added feature which will allow you to see how much this drink would cost you to buy the ingredients.

On the favorites page, you can view both the drinks that you’ve saved as favorites and the drinks that you’ve saved to make later.  It also allows you to delete drinks if you so choose.

There was a team that produced this project including Eric Sanders who was in charge of the JavaScript and the drinking APIs, Amy Wolgemuth who was responsible for the design and look of the app, and Aaron Holder who was helping with both the JavaScript and the look of the website.
